# Architecture
Model View View Model (MVVM)
> MVVM is an architectural pattern applied in applications to separate user interface 
code from data and business logic. With the clear separation of these components, all components 
of an app can be unit-tested, components can be reused within the app or across the app, and enhancements
 to the app can be made without refactoring all the components.

# Database
> SQLlite (Usage of Database Access Object)
